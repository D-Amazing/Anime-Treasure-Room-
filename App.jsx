// This code imports the necessary dependencies and components for the e-commerce product app.
// It uses React's useState hook to manage the state of the product list.
// The ProductList component is responsible for rendering the list of products,
// while the ProductItem component is used to display individual product details.
// The CSS files are imported to style the components.
// The app displays a list of anime-themed products, each with an image, name, price, and description.
// The products are stored in the state and passed to the ProductList component for rendering.
// The App component serves as the main entry point for the application,
// and it initializes the product data and renders the ProductList component.
// The app is styled with CSS to create a visually appealing layout for the product cards.
// The app is designed to be a simple e-commerce platform for anime merchandise,
// showcasing various products such as plushies, figures, and apparel.
// The app is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
// The app is structured into components, with each component responsible for a specific part of the UI.
// The app is designed to be responsive and user-friendly,
// allowing users to easily browse and view product details.
// The app is a great starting point for anyone looking to create an e-commerce platform using React.
